# Week 6

‚ùó Week 6 Assumes you are running Elasticsearch 8.12 or newer and have '.elser_model_2_linux-x86_64' installed and running in your environment

instructions for Installing and Deploying ELSERv2 are here: [link](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-elser.html)

This week we are going to reveal a full RAG example using LangChain.  We'll break it down into smaller parts to understand some of the nuance of what is going on later, but you already have most of the skills and tools to understand what's going on:  deployed models, ingest processors, search queries, and streamlit.

## Learning Objectives

* LangChain - Chunking
* LangChain - ElasticsearchStore
* Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Prepping the week 6 environment

Like always we are going to copy forward what we have from prior weeks

```bash
## make sure your venv is activated
## from the week06 folder
cp -R ../week05/app .
cp -R ../week02/STATE_OF_THE_UNION.pickle .
cp ../week05/.env .
cd app
rm -rf __pycache__
cd ..

```

## Chunking the State of the Union Data


We'll use a Python Notebook to show re-ingesting the State of the Union data for ELSER semantic search

[ELSER the State of the Union](ELSERsotu.ipynb)

## Learning just enough LangChain for RAG

Run the following notebook

[Just enough LangChain for RAG](LangChainForRAG.ipynb)

extra credit. if you want you mind blown try [SelfQuery Retrievers](SelfQuery.ipynb)

## Adding a RAG search to our Streamlit app

first let's go into the ```resources.py``` in our streamlit ```app```

at the top of the file where we import python libraries
```python
from langchain_elasticsearch import ElasticsearchStore
```

and then were we have cached resources (add to the bottom of the page below get_es() )
```python
@st.cache_resource
def get_es_semantic(index_name):
    es = get_es()
    elastic_vector_search = ElasticsearchStore(
        es_connection=es,
        index_name=index_name,
        strategy=ElasticsearchStore.SparseVectorRetrievalStrategy()
    )
    return elastic_vector_search
```

It's not a pefect app, it could use a lot more polish ... but use my example single-page RAG app but copy the file ```week6_sotu_rag.py``` into your ```app/pages/``` folder and start up the streamlit app to see simple RAG in action.

Things to check out in this code

* we use ELSER V2
* We use the LLM to interpret which president is being spoken of to filter speaches by metadata
* We pull back surrounding context from our numbered chunks
* We creat a citation to the State of the Union address URL
